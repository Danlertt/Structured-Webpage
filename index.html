      <p>The Story of the Olivia Pesto Chicken Sandwich
        Our founder's daughter, Olivia, joined our café team when she was 16.
        After talking with some regular customers, she felt we needed a pesto chicken sandwich.
        After many conversations with her mom and what she felt was slow progress on the R&D front,
        Olivia decided to take matters into her own hands and create a prototype of the sandwich. She presented the
        sandwich
        to the Gourmondo chef team for consideration, and the Olivia sandwich was born. It still bears her name today
        and is
        one of our most popular sandwiches.
        While we make our own basil and tomato pestos, one of our local grocery partners, PCC, carries several
        delicious
        options should you wish to use store-bought.
        When roasting the chicken breast, we lightly dust it with a spice blend called Svaneti salt.
        This blend comes directly from World Spice at the Pike Place Market. You are also welcome to use your favorite
        poultry seasoning.
